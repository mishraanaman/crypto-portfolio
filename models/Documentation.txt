http://localhost:8000/v1/transactions
http://localhost:8000/v1/transactions/:token
http://localhost:8000/v1/transactions/date/:date
​​http://localhost:8000/v1/transactions/:token/date/:date


I have listed my series of decisions while creating Crypto Portfolio Viewer APIs.

I have used the Express framework of Node JS to build the backend instead of Koa or Next.js because I found this framework fairly stable than the other 2. Its robust routing and middleware functionality has helped me to enhance my server capabilties.

I have separated the controller, business and DAO layer to reduce code interdependence and enhance maintainability.

I have ensured that versioning of the APIs is done, this will promote our users to use the latest version of APIs which will help us deprecate older versions with time.

Coming to nomics.api, I used this website because I could not fetch the latest prices of crypto currencies using crypto compare and I found this website very easy to use.

I have used csv-parser to parse the csv file. I found this module fairly easy to use and its popularity made it the clear winner.

I have allowed Cross Origin requests from port 3000 in case we try to build a front end later and we need this port for the frontend server.
